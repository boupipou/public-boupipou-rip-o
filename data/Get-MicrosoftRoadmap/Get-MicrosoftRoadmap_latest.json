However, this approach can be bypassed if a file is renamed with a misleading extension. To address this, we’re enhancing our detection logic to go beyond just the visible file extension.\n\nWith this update, even if a file’s extension is altered, Exchange will evaluate the actual content of the file to determine its true type. This ensures that policies based on file type—such as “File extension is…”—remain effective and secure, even in cases of renamed or disguised attachments.\n\nThis improvement provides customers with a more robust and reliable way to enforce compliance and security rules around file sharing.",

The behavior is now unified across all export jobs - same download experience, some report experience, same error messages.\nAdditionally, for Standard customers, the need to install a clickonce application in their machine and use that tool to download data for exporting in azure storage is history. Now, in the new experience, customers don’t need to install the app anymore and can download directly through browser. \nOther changes coming through are:\n- Change in Export limits and ZIP folder partitioning\n- Better Export settings with more options\n- New reporting capabilities\n- Enhancements in Results load file",

        "Description":  "The Purview eDiscovery team has increased the limits for Hold policies for eDiscovery Premium in the new purview.microsoft.com portal. \n\nThe maximum number of mailboxes in a single case hold has been increased from 1,000 to 2,000. This limit includes the combined total of user mailboxes and the mailboxes associated with Microsoft 365 Groups, Microsoft Teams, and Viva Engage Groups.\n\nThe maximum number of sites in a single case hold has been increased from 100 to 2,000. This limit includes the combined total of OneDrive for Business sites, SharePoint sites, and the sites associated with Microsoft 365 Groups, Microsoft Teams, and Viva Engage Groups. \n\nOverall, the maximum allowed locations in a premium case hold policy in a premium case is 4,000 (2,000 each). This is possible through the new user interface in Purview portal and not through the Classic eDiscovery experience. Additionally, this is not currently possible with Graph. The maximum hold limits for a standard case remain the same as earlier: 1,000 mailboxes and 100 sites. All other settings for eDiscovery hold continue as is. \n\nLastly, in case of license downgrade, the system won\u0027t remove any existing holds and won\u0027t allow adding more, such as for a policy with a higher number of locations in it (e.g. 1500 Mailbox and 1500 Sites), and if the case setting is downgraded to E3, you will not be able to add more locations in it based on E3 limits, but you will be able to remove locations from it.",

        "Description":  "This feature introduces SCO (Synchronous Connection-Oriented) user setting in the Walkie Talkie app. This feature is designed to manage the Bluetooth headset connection to optimize battery life. When a Bluetooth headset is connected to the Walkie Talkie app, the SCO setting controls whether the microphone remains constantly connected or disconnects after a period of inactivity. This helps in reducing battery drain by allowing the headset to disconnect when not in use and reconnect when needed.  The user control feature allows users to set a timeout period after which the Bluetooth headset will automatically disconnect if there is no activity. While the SCO setting is turned on, users may experience a slight delay in transmission as the headset reconnects. However, once the headset is reconnected, users will hear a sound indicating that they can start transmitting on the app. This brief delay is a small trade-off for the substantial battery savings on older Bluetooth headsets.",

Second, when transcription is enabled (whether by itself or when recording or Copilot are enabled) only the meeting organizer, co-organizers, and transcript initiator will be able to change the spoken language. Next, we’re simplifying the settings by creating a new settings page for meeting spoken language and translation language for live translated captions at Caption settings \u003e Language settings \u003e Meeting spoken language and transcript found at Transcript \u003e Language settings \u003e Meeting spoken language.  Lastly, when participants speak a language that doesn’t match the selected language in the spoken language setting, the meeting organizer, co-organizer and initiator will get a notification that the language is mismatched.",

This way meeting organizers will be able to manage which roles can initiate recording and transcription for a meeting. This functionality will be available to Teams Premium and Copilot for M365 licensed users. ",

This will help them formulate the right response action, like escalating the Incident to SOC teams for quick remediation, etc. \n\nMicrosoft Entra offers two types of compromised user detections.\n1. Sign in risk detections: compromise risk associated with a specific sign-in.\n2. User risk detections: compromise risk associated with a specific user.\n\nInsider risk management admins can opt into each of the above risk detections from Insider risk management global settings. Risk detections will be available in the indicator timeline within the alert investigation experience. Risk detections will not impact the risk score or severity of Insider risk management alerts.\n\nMicrosoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies based on their own internal policies, governance, and organizational requirements. Built with privacy by design, users are pseudonymized by default, and role-based access controls and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.  ",

The behavior is now unified across all export jobs - same download experience, some report experience, same error messages. For Standard customers, the need to install a clickonce application in their machine and use that tool to download data for exporting in azure storage is history. Now, in the new experience, customers don’t need to install the app anymore and can download directly through browser.

All other triggers will be limited to 5,000 per day per trigger. Additionally, the policy health warning messages will be enhanced to assist admins with appropriate permissions in identifying and addressing noisy triggers effectively.

        "Description":  "Stream (on SharePoint) video files tend to be large and consume considerable space against your OneDrive and SharePoint storage quotas. Currently, when you make changes to video metadata, such as adjustments to the video title, description, transcript, chapters, interactivity, thumbnails, or media settings, those changes trigger a new version (that includes both the video and metadata) to be created and stored in the version history for that file. Each of these versions consumes storage that counts towards your storage quota. To reduce the storage footprint driven by small changes, we are adjusting how Stream (on SharePoint) handles versions. Soon we will release an update to Stream version history. Once released, any changes made to the metadata of Stream files will no longer trigger an entirely new version in the file\u0027s version history. Instead, it will update the metadata of the most current version of the video in version history. If you edit the video itself, then a new version that includes both the video and metadata will be created and stored in the version history. Note: The update to Stream version history applies to Stream videos stored in OneDrive and SharePoint. SharePoint is also introducing new version history limits and controls that help tenant and site admins or document library owners reduce the storage footprint driven by low value file versions. These new version history limits and controls will only apply to Stream videos if changes to the video are made from within a SharePoint document library without opening the video in Stream (e.g. a file name change from within a SharePoint doc library). See Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID 145802 for more information on version history limits and controls.",

These controls enable admins to set an appropriate level of recoverability and auditability for their organization balanced with storage usage considerations.

Insider Risk Management extends its detection into multicloud environments by offering ready-to-use risk indicators in Azure, AWS, and SaaS apps including Box, Dropbox, and Google Drive. Organizations can use these new indicators in data theft and data leaks policies. Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Note: We have updated the cloud environments to reflect the current state.  We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.",
